		 <p>One man's trash is another person's treasure"? With the abundance of data available to us today, can we really find useful knowledge in it? And, is knowledge even useful? 
			 Join us in this mini-symposium where we will discuss what makes knowledge useful, when is knowledge useful, how we can represent it and its different applications. 
			 Our focus is on knowledge graphs and how to translate knowledge to the user, we discuss the open challenges and research directions around knowledge usability.</p>

		 <p>One person's trash is another person's treasure"? With the abundance of data available to us today, can we really find useful knowledge in it? And, is knowledge even useful? 
			 Join us in this mini-symposium where we will discuss what makes knowledge useful, when is knowledge useful, how we can represent it and its different applications. 
			 Our focus is on knowledge graphs and how to translate knowledge to the user, we discuss the open challenges and research directions around knowledge usability.</p>

		<h3><a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/on-graph-generating-dependencies-and-their-applications-in-data-p">Title: "On Graph Generating Dependencies and Their Application in Data Profiling"</a></h3>
		<p>Summary: Every day, we generate new data through various activities such as browsing new websites, conducting online searches, and accepting social media friend requests. Among the various types of data being generated, one type that has been gaining attention is graph data. Graph data represents information in a network-like structure, where objects are interconnected based on relationships or associations.
For data analysts, an important part of their job is to comprehend and extract relevant data that can improve the applications and solutions they are developing. However, given the diversity of daily generated data and the complexity of graph data, understanding this data can be both time-consuming and challenging.
In the field of Computer Science, data profiling is a research topic that aims at developing new methods to represent data and algorithms for gaining insights into datasets. A common way to represent information in this area is by using logical expressions. With the popularity of graph data, investigating how to express information from graph data is also of increasing interest. In this context, this thesis introduces a novel formalism known as Graph Generating Dependencies (GGDs), which enables the expression of semantic information derived from graph data. For example, in a social network graph, GGDs can express that if two people share the same last name and are labeled as "friends," they should also be connected as "family."
Additionally, this thesis proposes automated methods for discovering information represented by GGDs within datasets, demonstrating their utility in detecting potential errors in the data. By introducing this formalism and outlining its practical applications, this research contributes to advancing the field of data analysis and profiling, particularly in the context of graph data. Furthermore, the thesis outlines open challenges and directions for tasks like data profiling and data cleaning in graph data management systems.
